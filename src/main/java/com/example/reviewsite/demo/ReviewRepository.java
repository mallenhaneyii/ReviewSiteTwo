The story follows Tony Stark, owner of military contracted weapons corporation Stark Industries, and his journey to becoming the first Marvel hero Iron Man.  The movie is directed by Jon Favreau and stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n" + "\n" + "When Marvel Studios announced they were coming out with movies based on Marvel Comics, teenage Allen Haney was beyond excited. As a fan of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films I couldn’t wait to see Iron Man. I had never seen any of RDJ’s previous films which allowed me to go in with zero expectations, while others were skeptical based on his past performances and criminal record.\n" + "\n" + "He did not disappoint.  RDJ shows he was born for this role.  His ability to become a brilliant billionaire playboy philanthropist is a performance that rivals any lead role in a superhero film before him. Throughout the film you watch him grow as he is faced with life or death situations and the realization that he may be apart of the problem when it comes to war torn countries.\n" + "\n" + "By the end of the film Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man and kicks off a 23-movie franchise that spans over a decade long, with still no end in sight.  The film does a great job at paying homage to the comic book character while re-inventing him with modern day technology and world issues. Overall this film is still my favorite Marvel origin story. Re-watching still gives me the same excitement for the MCU I felt back in 2008.");

The story follows Bruce Banner, a doctor working in Rio De Janeiro at a soda bottling company.  He is also laying low working to control his emotions and heart rate to avoid turning into the Hulk.  The film is directed by Louis Leterrier and stars Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt.\n" + "\n" + "Having two Marvel movies in the same year seemed unreal.  We had never had two Batman, Superman or Spider-Man films in the same year.  Although this movie introduced the Hulk Marvel didn’t start the story by explaining why Bruce Banner is the Hulk and it was a great decision.  The viewers know who the Hulk is due to the 2003 film and the television film starring Lou Ferrigno.  Edward Norton was a big name and set big expectations for the film.\n" + "\n" + "The Incredible Hulk lacks the magic that MCU films have.  I believe this is just a sign of growing pains that Marvel experienced when they first started out building a cinematic universe.  The characters Bruce Banner and Thunderbolt Ross are the only things that are relevant to future Marvel movies, which is a big deal because most Marvel movies are intertwined and having hidden easter eggs referencing each other.\n" + "\n" + "As a whole; this is a good movie.  Edward Norton does a great job of portraying Bruce Banner even though his negotiations with Marvel lead to him only playing in this role one time.  Watching this movie gives you the perspective of the internal struggle Banner is dealing with and that is something that does carry through the entire saga.  The greatest thing this film did was have a cut scene that for the first time included two comic book characters from different. Needless to say, it blew my mind.");

After he revealed his identity at the end of the first movie he is faced with new challenges.  Anton Vanko, who worked with Howard Stark on the arc reactor, has just died and his son Ivan Vanko sees all the attention that Tony Stark is getting as a hero.  Jon Favreau returns as director and stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke.\n" + "\n" + "A sequel to a superhero film is something that doesn’t happen often.  And when they do occur it is rare that they satisfy the viewers.  RDJ was the same Tony Stark I knew and love.  Paltrow did an excellent job in her increased role as Tony’s love interest.  But Rourke’s characters as the villain seemed lack luster.  It seemed like a sub plot line when you thought he was the arc reactor technology wielding bad guy.  His first appearance with what seems to be the weapon that will take down Iron Man was the peak of his character.  He took a back seat to other villains like Justin Hammer.  Although Justin Hammer is a good character and it is fun to watch Tony Stark completely own him throughout the film.\n" + "\n" + "It was exciting to see Iron Man back on the big screen and watch the MCU progress forward.  Characters like War Machine and Black Widow make their first appearances and they supported the lead hero by giving the movie a more group feeling.  A feeling that will be utilize in future films to come.\n" + "\n" + "It is nearly impossible for a sequel to overcome the expectations the original creates, and this film fails to do so.  However, it’s still an awesome movie.  RDJ will never be boring to watch as Tony Stark.  Watching multiple superheroes fight side by side was a real treat.");

The movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh and stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins.\n" + "\n" + "Thor is a character I didn’t know much about growing up.  My father was able to tell me all about him as he read the comic books growing up.  It was exciting to go into a Marvel movie with no prior knowledge of the hero.  Hemsworth was a very little-known actor at the time which help the viewer not identify him as any other character decides Thor.  Portman and Hopkins were established actors and their involvement in this film gave the film a feel that it wasn’t just a superhero movie.  Think about it. Award winning Anthony Hopkins dressing up as a Norse god.  If he’s there, this film must mean business.\n" + "\n" + "Thor was able to introduce the idea that not all heroes come from earth without making it seems science fiction.  The characters seemed to be from another world in space which made it seem like they were aliens and the powers they had made sense for that reason.

The film is directed by Joe Johnston and stars Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan.\n" + "\n" + "In their fifth MCU movie Marvel continued with another origin story.  Chris Evans embodies what it means to be a patriot before he is granted the ability to defend his country.  After his transformation you can’t help being marvel at his abilities.  It is satisfying to see someone who is deserving of the gift he is given.  Tommy Lee Jones had a minor role, but it was perfect for him.  Hugo Weaving plays the villain and it was a treat to watch someone with his acting prowess in a Marvel film.  The crossover of superhero and war movie was executed very well.\n" + "\n" + "As far as carrying the universe forward this film did a lot, and the viewer doesn’t even realize it.  Many characters and aspects from this film were used in serval films that came after it.  At the time I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Looking back, I appreciate it even more for all that it set up for the MCU.");

The director is Joss Whedon and the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L Jackson.\n" + "\n" + "In 2012 I attended a Marvel movie marathon that started at noon the day before the release of Marvel's The Avengers.  It included every movie that came before and at midnight we watched Avengers for the first time.  Everyone was stellar.  Seeing heroes on the screen for second time like Hulk, Thor, Captain America was worth the hype.  Bruce Banner was being played by a new actor, Thor seemed to redefine himself as a hero and grow as a character, and Captain America was a soldier trying to get back to civilian life, in a new millennia of course.  They brought the action scenes to the next level.  We got to see Thor fight a lot more than we did in his origin film.  Hulk was a directed warrior instead of a loose cannon.  The greatest scene of all was all six Avengers side by side being lead by Captain America.  Literally the greatest scene in super hero movie history.\n" + "\n" + "Hiddleston is an incredible villain continuing his role as Loki.  The heroes come together and have a historic fight sequence in New York City against an alien army.  The CGI has aged but aged well.  The greatest thing about this movie is that it was the product Marvel Studios was working so hard to create.  A film that took the characters of 4 different stand alone films and putting them together seamlessly.  It's something that had never been accomplished in cinema.  \n" + "\n" + "There is literally nothing I can complain about this movie.  The acting, effects and story were all amazing across the board.  The villain and the idea that threats from outer space could come to earth blew the entire universe wide open.

He is making leaps in his technology and is about to make a big break when it comes to his arc reactor.  He and Pepper are officially and item and everything is going well until a terrorist organization calls Tony's bluff and attacks his Malibu home.  Tony must protect what has become most important while saving the world.  Rather than Jon Favreau like before Shane Black directs the film while Robert Downey Jr., Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Jon Favreau and Ben Kingsley.\n" + "\n" + "With Avengers in the past Iron Man 3 kicks off Phase Two of the MCU.  With a new director it definitely had a different tone that the first two films.  Something that was this film that was lacking in the sequel was Tony Stark smart side.  This movie illustrates that Tony's greatest weapon isn't his suit, it's his brain.  The special effects progress in a way that keeps it fresh.  You never feel like Iron Man is the same old guy fighting bad guys the same way he did in the last 3 movies he had been in.  It's just never boring to watch Tony Stark/ Iron Man on the big screen.\n" + "\n" + "Although this is the third film.  After a great origin movie kicking off the MCU and The Avengers coming out just a year before it was just impossible to live up to the hype.  This is the first time I had actual complaints about a Marvel film.  First is the villain.  There's a big misdirect in this film and in my opinion it took a lot more away from the film than adding to the plot.  There was a direction I thought they were going and frankly, they should have gone that way.");

The two of them work together to fight a new ancient threat.\n" + "\n" + "You can almost look at this movie as a sequel to Thor and Avengers.  Loki is the same Loki that was just the enemy of earth a couple movies ago and Thor has come so far since his first film he's almost a different person entirely.  It was fun to see Natalie Portman and her gang working with Thor again.  This movie started to bring humor into the movies in a new way.  Hiddleston is amazing yet again as Loki, delivering a performance that Marvel continues to include in their films.  The ending of this film is one of my favorites as it show cases the relationship of Thor and Loki. \n" + "\n" + "The masses didn't know how to react to this movie.  It kinda jumped head first into a comic book story that the MCU hadn't learned about before.  The villian of the movie are exclusive to this film.

Vers is a member of an elite squad known as Starforce.  She has abilities that aren't quite known that make her an excellent advocate for justice.  She finds herself crashed on planet earth in the early 90s.  While she attempts to find her way home she finds out more about her past and even something more about the leader of her team.  Co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Jude Law and Annette Bening.\n" + "\n" + "Captain Marvel is yet another origin story to introduce a new hero.  The 90s theme is something we haven't seen before in a Marvel film and was refreshing to see characters we love in a different time.  Going in I didn't know much about the character which made the movie a kind of a mystery mixed with a episode of Law and Order.  I found myself trying to figure out what was really going on with Captain Marvel and who the bad guys really were.\n" + "\n" + "The movie overall has a serious tone.  It did well at including comedy like they always do but you never forgot what was at stake.  Brie Larson, an Oscar winner, is great as a lead Marvel hero.  I left the movie wanting to know even more about her back story.  I felt that we only got half of why she is who she is.  But that's the great thing about Marvel Movies.  They always leave you wanting more.");

The movies takes place five years after the events of Infinity War and the heroes are defeated to say the least.  They are separated.  They are upset.  They are grieving.  They come together to find Thanos and figure out a way to reverse the tragedy that occurred five years ago.  The Russo brothers return to direct and with them the stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Brie Larson, Elizabeeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt.\n" + "\n" + "Here we go again.  Just one year after the largest crossover event were adding yet another hero to the mix to make it nine films worth of characters coming together.  This movie is truly an homage to the entire collection of MCU films.  There are constant reminders of the events of the past.  Chris Evans and RDJ work over all these years has come down to this.  The two of them are perfect on screen together.  The weight that is on each of their shoulders can be felt throughout the entire film.  You'll laugh, you'll cry.  You'll enjoy the most rewarding movie watching experience of all time after watching 22 films over 11 years.\n" + "\n" + "There truly couldn't have been a better way to end such an amazing Saga.  22 movies that tie together so well finally coming to a close.  I truly don't know if they'll be able to do it again.");
